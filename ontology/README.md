# Ontology

This directory contains the (unfinished) ontology for the archival data part of the Golden Agents project. The ontology is written to be compatible with the generic GA-Ontology (see releases in: https://github.com/knaw-huc/golden-agents-datasets). It was heavily inspired by the `roar` ontology (hence the name): https://w3id.org/roar. Please note that this ontology is NOT compatible with the `roar` ontology and should be considered as separate. 

For more information on the ideas behind this ontology, see for instance the follow publication:
